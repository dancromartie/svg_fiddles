<h2>Steganography Visualization</h2>
<p>This is a visualization of "Steganography" inside a video-ish thing.  Imagine that two people are trying to communicate secretly.  One could send the other 
a video, or upload it to a particular Youtube channel.  The video could be of someone's toddler doing something cute.  Tiny bits of each frame can be edited to encode 
a message in the video.</p>

<p>Imagine each of the blue dots as the background noise in a video.  We then sneak in the bigger blue dot to encode a certain numerical value.  Although the dot is shown bigger, it would really be just like the other dots.  Both the recipient and the sender know where to look at the grid during each frame of the video.  I've done this by using a "seed string" - a string that both parties would agree on, like a bible verse or end-of-day stock prices for Google in 2012.  The sender knows where to put the special dot, the recipient knows where to look, and the sender gives information by changing the blueness of the dot in each frame (taking values 0-255).  Here, each letter of the alphabet (plus other characters) maps to a blueness level.</p>

<h3>Input ----> </h3>
<textarea id='input-text'>
    The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet. He is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle. He has a fine Geneva watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, and so being sure of the information when he wants it, the man in the street does not know a star in the sky. The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows as little; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind. His note-books impair his memory; his libraries overload his wit; the insurance-office increases the number of accidents; and it may be a question whether machinery does not encumber; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy, by a Christianity entrenched in establishments and forms, some vigor of wild virtue. For every Stoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian?
